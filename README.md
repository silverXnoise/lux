## Development

Slow.

## Support

N/A

## Build/Install Instructions

Would be nice.

## License

This is not intended for distribution. All component sources will be included as modules, and are subject to their respective licenses. It is my intention to honor all open source licenses and standards, should any of this become a "release".

## AI Statement

AI exists. I don't always use it. Sometimes I do. If you see anything problematic or questionable, it's the AI's fault. Not really. I am responsible for whatever the machines concoct at my prompting, if there's anything concerning or problematic in this repository, let me know in the issues and I'll sort it out.

## Even more fluff

Is there a physical limit on the length of a Slim Jim?
